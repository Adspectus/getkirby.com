Title: Panel issues

Text:

## OPcache

When OPcache settings are too aggressive, it can happen that responses are not updated, for example resulting in changes in the Panel not being updated (e.g the user language or the display language).

Adding this line in the `.htaccess` has helped users fixing this issue:

```
php_value opcache.revalidate_freq 0
```

## Panel Error Messages

### "The following HTTP methods are not supported by your server"

The API behind the Kirby Panel relies on HTTP `PATCH`, `PUT` and `DELETE` requests. If any of these are blocked, the Panel will not function properly.

Please check the following if you are seeing this error:

- A proxy (common in office networks) may be too old or may block these requests on purpose. You can rule out this issue by creating a (link: try text: personal demo) from the affected client. If that doesn't work as well, it's likely a proxy issue.
- Some hosting providers offer features to allegedly increase security. For example OVH's "app firewall" is known to cause these issues. Try disabling such features.
- The web server itself or a reverse proxy that is set up on the server-side in front of the web server may block the requests (again either because it's too old or because someone has explicitly configured it this way). If your web server is Apache, verify if there is `mod_security` rule that blocks some or all of the mentioned HTTP methods.

### "The JSON response from the API could not be parsed. Please check your API connection."

The API responses get modified or blocked somewhere between Kirby and the client. This is commonly caused by the same issues as the "The following HTTP methods are not supported by your server" error on Kirby installations with Kirby <3.4.0.

## Fields not saving or resetting to the saved value immediately when typing

Please refer to the section on the "The following HTTP methods are not supported by your server" error above.

## Fields randomly not saving, random logoutsâ€¦

If you randomly can't save pages, are randomly logged out or cannot log out without refreshing the browser, try disabling your browser's cache.

## Field content saving but not updating in Panel

Check if you have are sending Cache-Control headers or have set Expires HTTP headers in the `mod_expires` module in your `.htaccess`/server configuration.
