## Blueprint setup

You can add the Blocks field to any fields section in your Panel like this:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
```

## Field properties

Property | Type | Default | Description
- | - | - | - |
autofocus | `bool` | - | Sets the focus on this field when the form loads. Only the first field with this label gets
default | `array` | - | Default value for the field, which will be used when a page/file/user is created
disabled | `bool` | - | If true, the field is no longer editable and will not be saved
empty | `string` | - | Customize the default text when the blocks field is empty
fieldsets | `array` | - | Defines the allowed block types in the blocks field. See below.
help | | - | Optional help text below the field
label | | - | The field label can be set as string or associative array with translations
max | `int` | - | Maximum number of allowed blocks
min | `int` | - | Minimum number of required blocks
pretty | `bool` | `false` | Saves pretty printed JSON in text files
required | `bool` | `false` | If true, the field has to be filled in correctly to be saved.
translate | `bool` | `true` | If false, the field will be disabled in non-default languages and cannot be translated. This is only relevant in multi-language setups.
when |  | - | Conditions when the field will be shown (since 3.1.0)
width | `string` | `1/1` | The width of the field in the field grid. Available widths: `1/1`, `1/2`, `1/3`, `1/4`, `2/3`, `3/4`

## Defining Fieldsets

You can fully customize the selector for new block types with sorted block types and groups. By default, the block selector just shows a single list of available block types in alphabetical order:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
```

(screenshot: single.png)

When you want to change the order of available blocks, you need to list them manually with the `fieldsets` option

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - list
      - image
      - gallery
      - video
      - code
      - markdown
```

(screenshot: single-sorted.png)

### Groups

When you work with a lot of block types – especially when you start creating your own block types – you might want to group them in the block selector to give a better overview of available options.

The Blocks field has a generic "group" block type, which can be used to create such groups.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```

(screenshot: groups.png)

### Closed groups

When your list of block types gets even longer, you can also create groups that are closed by default for block types that are not needed that frequently.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        open: false
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```

## Block types

(reference: panel/blocks)

## Custom block types

You can create your own Block types for the Blocks field in the same way you might already know from the famous Builder plugin. In fact, the Blocks field is our effort to embed the functionality of the Builder into the core of Kirby.

Custom blocks can be defined directly in the fieldsets list:

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      button:
        name: Button
        icon: bolt
        fields:
          link:
            type: url
          text:
            type: text
```

In the example above, we mix the unchanged default block types (heading and text) with our own custom block type to add a call to action button

### Preview

Custom block types don't have a visual preview by default. They show up with the icon and the name from your blueprint definition.

(screenshot: preview.png)

### Editing

To edit a custom block type, the editor can either double-tap on the block or click on the edit icon in the toolbar. The block drawer opens with the fields you've defined.

(screenshot: editing.png)

### Tabs

Like in the builder field, you can also define tabs for your blocks when they need a lot of settings

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    label: Text
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      button:
        name: Button
        icon: bolt
        tabs:
          content:
            fields:
              link:
                type: url
              text:
                type: text
          styles:
            fields:
              class:
                type: text
              id:
                type: text
```

The tabs will then show up in the block drawer

(screenshot: tabs.png)

### Global block types

A more reusable way to store such a custom block type definition is in a folder called `site/blueprints/blocks`. In this case we would store it in `/site/blueprints/blocks/button.yml`:

```yaml
# /site/blueprints/blocks/button.yml
name: Button
icon: bolt
tabs:
  content:
    fields:
      link:
        type: url
      text:
        type: text
  styles:
    fields:
      class:
        type: text
      id:
        type: text
```

Now, we can use it in our fieldsets option for any blocks field.

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - button
```

Of course, this also works in groups:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
          - button
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```

### Custom block type snippet

To render the HTML for your custom block type, it needs a snippet in `/site/snippets/blocks`. In this case we would create a file called `/site/snippets/blocks/button.php`

```php "/site/snippets/blocks/button.php"
<a href="<?= $block->link() ?>" class="btn">
  <?= $block->text() ?>
</a>
```

## Preview plugins

You can turn your custom blocks into highly visual, interactive representations with a custom block preview plugin.

(image: custom-preview.png class: screenshot link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/blocks)

**(link: docs/reference/plugins/extensions/blocks text: Read our plugin guide, how to create such previews.)**

## Extending core blocks

You can take our core blocks as a starting point for your own custom blocks and extend them with your own fields, snippets and previews. Extending our core blocks is working the same way as extending fields, tabs, sections in blueprints everywhere else.

### Example: extending the heading block

Let's take the heading block and add a simple text field to add a custom ID for the heading

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    heading:
      extends: blocks/heading
      fields:
        customId:
          label: Custom ID
          type: text
```

This will add the `customID` field below the default fields of the block.

(screenshot: custom-id.png)

### Extending existing fields

Instead of only adding new fields, you can also adjust the field settings for the default fields of the block.

Let's limit the number of heading levels for our heading block.

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    heading:
      extends: blocks/heading
      fields:
        level:
          options:
            - h2
            - h3
```

You can find all block fields and their settings in the (link: docs/reference/panel/blocks text: docs for each block).

### Adding tabs

You can extend our core blocks with additional tabs. Be aware though that you need to recreate all default fields in this case, as tabs will replace the default fields.

```yaml
fields:
  blocks:
  type: blocks
  fieldsets:
    heading:
      extends: blocks/heading
      tabs:
        content:
          fields:
            level:
              type: select
              empty: false
              default: "h2"
              width: 1/6
              options:
                - h1
                - h2
                - h3
            text:
              type: writer
              inline: true
              width: 5/6
            customId:
              label: Custom ID
              type: text
        styles:
          fields:
            backgroundColor:
              type: select
              options:
                - red
                - green
                - blue
            textColor:
              type: select
              options:
                - white
                - black
```

## Configuration

You can configure the default setup of your Blocks field in your config.php

```php "/site/config/config.php"
<?php

return [
  'blocks' => [
    'fieldsets' => [
      'text' => [
        'label' => 'Text',
        'type' => 'group',
        'fieldsets' => [
          'text',
          'heading'
        ]
      ],
      'media' => [
        'label' => 'Media',
        'type' => 'group',
        'fieldsets' => [
          'image',
          'video'
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
];
```

## Builder migration

The Blocks field is replacing the popular Builder field plugin. It comes with a built-in smart importer for Builder blocks. The migration should normally be effortless.

### Your blueprints

The only thing you have to change to upgrade from the Builder to the new Blocks field is to change the field type:

*previously:*

```yaml "builder"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: builder
    fieldsets:
      ...
```

*now:*

```yaml "blocks"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      ...
```

### Your templates

The Builder used a field method called `$page->blocks()->toBuilderBlocks()`. This has to be replaced with `$page->blocks()->toBlocks()`

### Your block snippets

Your old block snippets should work as expected, but a few things are deprecated and you should follow the new way of doing things in the snippets:

The new `$block` object replaces `$data` You can still use `$data` instead, but consider this deprecated. The following `$block` object methods replace the old `$data` methods:

Builder | Blocks
- | -
`$data->_uid()` | `$block->id()`
`$data->_key()` | `$block->type()`


## Editor migration

The Blocks field is not just replacing the Builder but also our Editor field plugin. It has a built-in smart importer for Editor blocks. The migration should normally be mostly effortless. There are a couple block types that have changed though and you might need to update your editor block snippets.

### Your blueprints

The only thing you have to change to upgrade from the Editor to the new Blocks field is to change the field type:

*previously:*

```yaml "editor"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: editor
```

*now:*

```yaml "blocks"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
```

### Changed snippets

The following block types have changed in the Blocks field and you need to move and rename your snippets if you have customized them in your installation.

Editor | Blocks
- | -
`/site/snippets/editor/h1.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/heading.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/h2.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/heading.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/h3.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/heading.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/blockquote.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/quote.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/kirbytext.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/markdown.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/ol.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/list.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/paragraph.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/text.php`
`/site/snippets/editor/ul.php` | `/site/snippets/blocks/list.php`
