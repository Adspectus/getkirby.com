Text:

The url field is a standard text field with the type `url` and a custom URL icon. It comes with built-in validation for URLs.

<info>
The URL validation may lead to incorrect results (= a valid URL being marked as invalid or the other way around) in rare edge-cases. In those edge-cases you can manually input the URL into the content text files or switch to a simple text field.

## Example

```yaml
fields:
  url:
    label: URL
    type: url
```

## Field properties

(field-options: url)
