Title: The block selector

----

Intro: You can fully customize the selector for new block types with sorted block types and groups

----

Text:

## Default

By default, the block selector just shows a single list of available block types in alphabetical order:

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
```

When you want to change the order of available blocks, you need to list them manually with the `fieldsets` option

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      - heading
      - text
      - list
      - image
      - gallery
      - video
      - code
      - markdown
```

## Groups

When you work with a lot of block types – especially when you start creating your own block types – you might want to group them in the block selector to give a better overview of available options.

The Blocks field has a generic "group" block type, which can be used to create such groups.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```

## Closed groups

When your list of block types gets even longer, you can also create groups that are closed by default for block types that are not needed that frequently.

```yaml
fields:
  text:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      text:
        label: Text
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - heading
          - text
          - list
      media:
        label: Media
        type: group
        fieldsets:
          - image
          - video
      code:
        label: Code
        type: group
        open: false
        fieldsets:
          - code
          - markdown
```
