## In your blueprints

The only thing you have to change to upgrade from the Builder to the new Blocks field is to change the field type:

*previously:*

```yaml "builder"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: builder
    fieldsets:
      ...
```

*now:*

```yaml "blocks"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
    fieldsets:
      ...
```

## In your templates

The Builder used a field method called `$page->blocks()->toBuilderBlocks()`. This has to be replaced with `$page->blocks()->toBlocks()`

## In your block snippets

Your old block snippets should work as expected, but a few things are deprecated and you should follow the new way of doing things in the snippets:

The new `$block` object replaces `$data` You can still use `$data` instead, but consider this deprecated. The following `$block` object methods replace the old `$data` methods:

Builder | Blocks
- | -
`$data->_uid()` | `$block->id()`
`$data->_key()` | `$block->type()`
