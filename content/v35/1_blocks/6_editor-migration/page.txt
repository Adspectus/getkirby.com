Title: Editor migration

----

Intro: The Blocks field is replacing our Editor field for long-form text. Learn how to migrate your Editor blocks.

----

Text:

The Blocks field has a built-in smart importer for Editor blocks. The migration should normally be mostly effortless. There are a couple block types that have changed though and you might need to update your editor block snippets.

## In your blueprints

The only thing you have to change to upgrade from the Editor to the new Blocks field is to change the field type:

*previously:*

```yaml "editor"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: editor
```

*now:*

```yaml "blocks"
fields:
  blocks:
    type: blocks
```

## Changed snippets

The following block types have changed in the Blocks field and you need to move and rename your snippets if you have customized them in your installation.
